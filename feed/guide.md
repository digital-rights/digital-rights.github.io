## What is RSS and what does it have to do with email?

Here on Digital Rights we advocate for sensible technology built for people in mind, platforms like social media are a popular way to notify your audience, other online campaigns use email chains to get their message across, but social media or email are deeply flawed.

The problem with these methods is that **they are built without respect for your time or attention**, take for example Facebook: If you like a page then you are supposed to get notified right? - _yes but that is not the whole picture_ - each time you get notified about new posts you are also incentivised to navigate the rest of Facebook and indirectly making you waist your time. Because when you like our page you will see our posts on the infinite scrolling feed, clicking one link sends you into a potential time sink rabbit hole.

The same can be said about every social media platform, they all get one important thing wrong: _they make you waist your time_, so to get important update from us we choose to provide our readers with choices.


## Follow us on social media.

You can get updates from our social media accounts and potentially end up waisting your time on their infinite feeds or you can use our non infinite feed isolated from social media.

## Use our non addictive feed (RSS)

RSS feeds are simple webpages that give you chronological updates about any given topic, to read any RSS feed you need an RSS reeder

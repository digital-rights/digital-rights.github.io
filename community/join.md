## What can organization members do that community members don't?

A community member is someone who engages with and shares our content, for example a Reddit subscriber or a social media follower. Community members can comment, share and remix our work freely with no barriers of entry.

Community members can also submit their own content and publish their content via our site or social media accounts. To submit your work as a community member you unfortunately need to jump through hoops, we have extensive and rigid instructions for community contributions to filter content not aligned with our values.

So if you intend to be a part of our community and publish your work only once you have to comply with the submission instructions.

If instead you plan to contribute regularly it would be a hassle to go through the submission filter every time, if this is your case you can become a member to bypass this filtering process.

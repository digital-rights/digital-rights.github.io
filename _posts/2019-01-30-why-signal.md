## Why use signal over other messengers like WhatsApp?

Download signal over at [signal.org](https://signal.org).

1. firstly unlike whatsАрр, Signal is open source meaning anyone can inspect the code and verify it's security and that there are no back doors. 

1. Unlike whatsapp, Signal is not owned by the data mining company facebooκ. 

1. it uses stronger and more unique end to end encryption. End to end encryption means no one except you and the recipient can read any message (not even the company that owns the platform can read any messages),WhatsApp has this feature too but it's compromised by the fact that chats are automatically backed up on Google drive without encryption, this setting is on by default meaning Google has personal information on most WhatsApp users and sells/leverages it. On the other hand almost all other chat apps and email services can access your messages because they aren't protected with encryption, meaning actual people you don't know can  access, sell or leak your personal information.

1. it has it's own notification system so the phone and apps can't read your messages in the notification tray.

1. it prevents screenshots or unrestricted screen recording from a virus or the operating system itself. 

1. It has a disappearing message setting which wipes conversations after a set time from both phones (useful to keep chats clean or to simply erase personaI information if needed).

1. It has a dark mode, saving your eyes and battery.

8. Most impressively it has encrypted sender meta data. That means the sender's phone number is masked over the Internet. Meta data is visibIe to anyone looking out for it. The NSА meta data to monitor who is messaging who at what time world wide.

9. It can handle your sms's,  storing them with encryption,  ensuring no other apps can read them.

10. you can set a password for the app, meaning peopIe can't simply read your messages if they have physical access to your phone.

11. You can relay your calls through signaIs servers to avoid revealing your IP address(which reveaIs your location) if you don't already use a VPN. 

12. It's under constant improvement, the Signal developers prioritize the user's needs over everyone else's.

1. Unlike many apps, it has no trackers hidden in the code. (Trackers report information of a user and their device back to the company)

1. WhatsАpp, Instagram and Facebook messenger [are combining][bbc], making personal information across platforms more linked.

The one disadvantage: Messages are limited to 1000 characters each.

## The privacy argument

We all naturally want and need privacy and security, otherwise why would we have doors, walls, passwords, keys.

The problem is that we assume our personal data is safe because we think nobody is interested in it or we don't consider how it could be used against us.

Also we have slowly been conditioned to decide that putting our life online is convenient, fun and the social norm. We don't stop to question the need for the digital logs of our lives. 

Most personal information does not even need to be posted online to begin with. Often we post online because we're afflicted by loneliness and looking for love and approval or looking for a distraction from reality.

We may not see an immediate need for privacy but privacy might become a commodity it in future. Information you put out there is probably there forever, if something changes in political leadership (look at Venezuela) presents a new threat,  you can't take the years of data back or hide amongst the crowd.

Ask many German citizens what they think of privacy, based on their history. Or look at what's happening in Zimbabwe and China currently with monitoring and censorship of public communications. It just takes one mistake to forever compromise our information. Remember the old saying _"Knowledge is power"_,the more people know about you the more power or influence they have over you.

> "Saying that you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide, is like saying that you don't care about freedom of speech because you have notҺing to say"

Profit driven companies given access to our data will use it to manipulate their users and drive our decisions in their best monetary interests.

Privacy can also help save you money in various ways.
